# FIN-ENG-Bioinformatics-Vocabulary
At the late 1990’s the Bioverkko network consisting of Finnish bioinformatics specialists decided to collect a Finnish-English bioinformatics vocabulary. The aim was to create a vocabulary to develop and uniform the Finnish bioinformatics vocabulary and thus support the teaching and research on bioinformatics. The following persons belonged to the working group that created the first version of the vocabulary: Erja Heikkinen (CSC), Marjo Korpi (TAY), Kimmo Mattila (CSC), Ilkka Porali (JOY) and Mauno Vihinen (TAY). The first version of the vocabulary was published 2000 on the CSC’s web site. 2011 CSC transferred the maintenance and development of the vocabulary to the Finnish Bioinformatics society. The vocabulary was carefully revised by Mauno Vihinen in 2012 when many new terms were introduced and outdated ones removed.
